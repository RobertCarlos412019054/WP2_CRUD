                        <p>On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. stepped out onto his balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, and was shot. The civil rights leader died at the Memphis Hospital at 39 years old. The killer, James Earl Ray, was caught and pleaded guilty a year later. However, many people, including King's own children, do not believe Ray acted alone.</p>

                        <p>Some believe the FBI or the Ku Klux Klan were involved in the assassination and believe Ray was framed, according to NPR. The US Justice Department investigated the death on three separate occasions. Once, they concluded that there may have been a wider conspiracy, but there is no hard evidence to support it.</p>
